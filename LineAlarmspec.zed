This specification describes ...

This type represents the different states
of if the line is clear and 
able to dispense if other conditions are 
correct or blocked and not able to dispense
\begin{zed}
  ErrorState ::= clear | blocked % added this
\end{zed}

This type represents the different problems
possible in the line.  occlusion means the 
line is plugged or pinched.  out_of_medicine
means that the line does not have 
\begin{zed}
  Problem ::= occlusion | out\_of\_medicine
\end{zed}



This schema represents the current amount of medicine 
on a specific line.
\begin{schema}{MedicineLine}
  medicineAmount: \nat \\
  blockedCheck : ErrorState \\% added this
  currentProblems : \power Problem
\end{schema}

The initial state of the medicine on a line is to be empty
\begin{schema}{InitMedicineLine}
  MedicineLine
\where
  medicineAmount = 0 \\
  blockedCheck = clear \\% added this
  currentProblems = \emptyset %added this
\end{schema}

Defines the amount of medicine put in the line
when it is filled up.
\begin{axdef}
  fillAmount: \nat
\where
  fillAmount = 2
\end{axdef}


The action modelling refilling the medicine in a line.
It can be done at any time and fills the medicine 
back up to the fillAmount.
\begin{schema}{RefillLine}
  \Delta MedicineLine
\where
  medicineAmount' = fillAmount \\
  blockedCheck' = blockedCheck \\ %added this
  currentProblems' = currentProblems %added this
\end{schema}

The dispense medicince action dispenses one unit of 
medicine per action.  It requires that the amount
of medicine in the line is greater than 0.
\begin{schema}{SuccessfulDispenseMedicine}
  \Delta MedicineLine
\where
  medicineAmount > 0 \\
  blockedCheck = clear \\ % added this
  medicineAmount' = medicineAmount - 1 \\ % added this
  blockedCheck' = clear  % added this
  
\end{schema}

This function models the medicine dispensing becoming 
blocked.  The schema has the same pre states as the 
SuccessfulDispenseMedicine schema
\begin{schema}{DispenseMedicineGetsBlocked} % added this
  \Delta MedicineLine
\where
  medicineAmount > 0 \\
  blockedCheck = clear \\ % added this
  medicineAmount' = medicineAmount \\ % added this
  blockedCheck' = blocked   % added this
\end{schema}

This schema represents the ability of the line to become
blocked while dispensing but also allows the line to 
dispense medicince successfully.
\begin{zed}
  NonDeterministicDispenseMedicine == SuccessfulDispenseMedicine \lor DispenseMedicineGetsBlocked % added this 
\end{zed}
